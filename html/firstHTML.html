            <b>Shinra Kusakabe</b> Shinra Kusakabe is a Third and Fourth Generation pyrokinetic
            in the service of Special Fire Force Company 8. After his mother's death, and supposedly
            his younger brother's as well, Shinra joined the Special Fire Force to achieve his goal of
            becoming a hero, saving people from Spontaneous Human Combustion, and uncovering the truth
            behind his family's death twelve years ago.

            also noteworthy as his pupils are white instead of black. When he was introduced, Shinra wore a dark jacket
            with a button on his collar shaped like a cross-like insignia
            over a light shirt, dark trousers and a belt. He also wore dark shoes which he burnt through via his
            Ignition Ability, and was noted to have done multiple times.
